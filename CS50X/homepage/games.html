                    Noticed the screencast button on my phone while testing, so I searched and added disableRemotePlayback
                    and it's gone. I got animated pngs from https://www.steamgriddb.com/, then converted them using
                    handbrake to webm's as to reduce playback problems and load time.

                    Even though, I was gaming since I was 5 years old, Cod Mw2 from 2009 was my first game on steam
                    and my first game on my own personal computer. In 2010, my Dad was able to buy me a completely
                    new computer as the old one we had was still running a pentium 4 and a geforce with 128MB VRAM.
                    Thanks to this new one, I was able to play the latest titles, and more specially, cod mw2 online,
                    which led into a friendship that would last some years, and I have a lot of fond memories playing
                    with that particular friend.

                    This game made me think about something, I might have never connected, games are the future of art
                    it's a combination of everything we create, music, paintings, stories. This game will forever be
                    ingrained in my mind as one of the best.

                    As covid raged, there I was in my house playing the future. I didn't get the exposure to the early
                    half-life games as a lot of pc gamers did, but goddamn, the universe created here feels authentic
                    and the medium, VR, is just another level. I can't wait for more experiences like this.
