            In accordance with the idea, of not copy pasting, the same stuff over and over in each new page.
            I dynamically added the head elements with the scripts.js, but I faced loading problems, since it tried
            to load the website before the javascript ended inserting the css. So I decided to show nothing until
            the whole page was loaded.

            But then, I saw the spinners in the bootstrap doc and added it to my scripts file.

                    Hi, my name is Paulo, online I usually go by BlazeDator,
                    which was a name I picked as a little kid when I first created my steam account in 2010.

                    I finished High school around 2015, not having any prospects to study further, I had a small sewing/leather goods
                    learning formation for 3 months, landing a job in January of 2017. I worked there until November of 2018 then landing another job,
                    in the same field in March of 2019, which is the job I have now, as of September 2022.

                <p>
                    In 17th of July 2022, I started CS50 online, because I'm bit tired of a lot of factors of my job, and since I learned a bit of
                    programming in high school, including C++, visual basic, sql, html, css, js, I wanted to get a job related to the area, so I been
                    in this process for the last two months, give or take. I'm very happy with the progress I'm making, and loving the problems given, as
                    they're really fun to figure out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shoutout to the people behind CS50, you're amazing, thank you!

                    I usually fill my time with video games, music, movies, shows. So there's been some which I really liked, so for this problem set
                    I choose to show some off. On the other pages, you'll find some of my favorites.
