# Helper -- From Lecture 1 --

# For each knowledge base, youâ€™ll likely want to encode two different types of information:
#   (1) information about the structure of the problem itself (i.e., information given in the definition of a Knight and Knave puzzle),
#   and (2) information about what the characters actually said.


# In each of the above puzzles,
#   Each character is either a knight or a knave.
#   A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true.
#   Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.

# Consider what it means if a sentence is spoken by a character.
#   Under what conditions is that sentence true?
#   Under what conditions is that sentence false?
#   How can you express that as a logical sentence?
